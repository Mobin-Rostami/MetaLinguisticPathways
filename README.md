# MetaLinguisticPathways
Research project investigating metalinguistic pathways in language learning

In this repository I have uploaded research materials for a project investigating meta-linguistic awareness pathways.

My organization:

- `data/`: Raw and processed datasets.
- `docs/`: Proposals, ethical approvals, teacher testimonials, and recorded sessions.
- `analysis/`: Python and R scripts, Excel sheets, and figures.
- `tests/`: Pre- and post-test instructions, questions, and scoring rubric.
