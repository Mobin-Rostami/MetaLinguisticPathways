# Scoring Rubric for Pre- and Post-Intervention Grammar Assessment

## 1. Introduction and Theoretical Alignment

The present rubric is designed for the systematic evaluation of participants’ performance on two parallel diagnostic instruments — the pre-test and post-test — developed to assess the impact of **meta-linguistic awareness** in three interrelated domains:

1. **Parts of Speech Recognition** (lexical categorization at the morphological and syntactic levels)  
2. **Word Order Mastery** (syntactic linearization and adherence to canonical SVO sequencing in English, including transformational structures)  
3. **Layered-Level Language Organization** (hierarchical acquisition model in which foundational structures, e.g., *Yes/No interrogatives*, scaffold subsequent acquisition of more complex structures such as *Wh-interrogatives*, compound-complex sentences, and rhetorical inversion)

By operationalizing these constructs within discrete, scored tasks, this rubric ensures that the assessment is not only **content-valid** (aligned with the intended linguistic domains) but also **methodologically rigorous**, enabling both **intra-participant longitudinal analysis** and **inter-participant comparison** via statistical modelling in R and Python.

## 2. Rubric Structure

Each test consists of six sections (Parts A–F), maintaining **construct parity** across pre- and post-assessment to ensure *test–retest reliability*. The rubric allocates a fixed point value per section (total = 100) to facilitate **comparability** and **weighted contribution analysis** in subsequent quantitative evaluation.

| Section | Construct Targeted | Point Value | Scoring Criteria |
|---------|--------------------|-------------|------------------|
| A — What Kind of Word? | Morphological awareness & lexical classification without explicit grammatical metalabels | 15 | See §3.1 |
| B — Make It More Interesting | Controlled syntactic transformation and semantic enrichment | 15 | See §3.2 |
| C — Ask Questions | Hierarchical interrogative formation (Yes/No → Wh) and syntactic reconfiguration | 20 | See §3.3 |
| D — Write a Short Story | Extended discourse construction with attention to syntactic variety and cohesion | 15 | See §3.4 |
| E — Fix the Mistakes | Error detection, hypothesis testing, and grammatical reconstruction | 20 | See §3.5 |
| F — Write a Letter | Functional writing, pragmatic appropriateness, and register control | 15 | See §3.6 |

## 3. Section-Specific Scoring Criteria

### 3.1 Part A — Lexical Category Identification (15 points)
- **Accuracy of selection**: Correct option reflecting semantic-syntactic function of the target word within context (3 pts each)
- **Distractor discrimination**: Evidence of rejecting plausible but incorrect alternatives (implicit cognitive load)

*Analytic Lens*: Tests bottom-up parsing ability in morpho-syntax without relying on explicit grammatical terminology, ensuring accessibility for A2-level learners while capturing underlying meta-linguistic competence.

---

### 3.2 Part B — Sentence Transformation & Enrichment (15 points)
- **Prompt adherence**: Required lexical/syntactic modification present (1 pt)
- **Grammatical integrity**: Maintains syntactic well-formedness post-transformation (1 pt)
- **Communicative enhancement**: Semantic enrichment or improved flow without distortion of core meaning (1 pt)

*Analytic Lens*: Reflects the learner’s ability to manipulate sentence structures, integrating *controlled syntactic variation* with semantic intent — a precursor skill for rhetorical inversion and stylistic modulation.

---

### 3.3 Part C — Hierarchical Interrogative Construction (20 points)
- **Form-function mapping**: Produces structurally and semantically valid Yes/No, Wh-, and adjunct interrogatives
- **Layered acquisition model**: Demonstrates understanding that Wh-structures are derivable from Yes/No bases (meta-awareness of syntactic scaffolding)
- **Accuracy weighting**: Yes/No and Wh-questions weighted higher for their foundational role (7 pts each); adjunct interrogative weighted slightly lower (6 pts)

*Analytic Lens*: This section operationalizes your **layer-based learning hypothesis** — tracking whether explicit awareness of foundational interrogative forms accelerates mastery of derived question types.

---

### 3.4 Part D — Narrative Construction (15 points)
- **Cohesion & Coherence**: Logical sequencing and thematic unity (5 pts)
- **Grammatical range**: Use of varied clause types (5 pts)
- **Lexical appropriacy**: Vocabulary matches context and A2 proficiency (5 pts)

*Analytic Lens*: Measures capacity to transcend simple clause chaining and progress toward complex and compound structures — an essential outcome variable for your hypothesis on layered syntactic development.

---

### 3.5 Part E — Error Identification & Correction (20 points)
- **Detection accuracy**: Locates the error in each sentence (2 pts)
- **Correction validity**: Produces target-like correction maintaining original semantic intent (2 pts)

*Analytic Lens*: Captures **interlanguage monitoring skills** — the internalized grammatical awareness that supports self-correction in spontaneous production.

---

### 3.6 Part F — Functional Written Communication (15 points)
- **Task fulfillment**: Communicative purpose achieved (8 pts)
- **Register appropriacy**: Politeness strategies and formal conventions (4 pts)
- **Grammatical integrity**: Accurate use of tense, agreement, and word order (3 pts)

*Analytic Lens*: Evaluates the applied end of meta-linguistic competence — the ability to deploy syntactic and lexical resources to meet a real-world communicative goal.


**Total Test Score: 100 points**
